<p>GitHub, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project.</p>
<h2>
Github Workflow
</h2>
<p>
Github is a version control system which basically means any project that a company or a develeper working on can be staged for commit (which saves your work upto that point) to its respective repository. This helps them to look upon any upgrade they wanna do without touching the original codebase by creating another branch (say fake) with main branch (main-master branch is kind of root of all other branches and other branches you create are completely the original copy of master branch ). If they feel there work on "fake" branch is better version of original then they can commit these changes to the master branch without breaking any code.

<ol>
<li>Search Field : <p>
This come handy when you have like 30 repositories and want to search a specific repo to work on and this make task easy and avoid the hassle of searching yourself through long list of repositeros.
</p></li>
<li>Pull Request: <p>
First you need to understand the concept of pull requests, for example: In events like Hacktoberfest students all over the world contribute to open-source projects available on github, but imagine what may happen if somebody writes wrong code and all codebase gets broken. So, to avoid such changes Github came up with the concept of pull requests, first to make changes one needs to make the neccessary changes in a forked repoistory and push these changes to the original one by issuing a pull request and then the maintainer of the open-source looks into the code and if there is no issue in the code, then PR gets accepted and the changes to codebase are made.

<li>Marketplace:
<p>
As the name suggests it is a Market but of github tools which make your job easier in the development phase.There are both free and paid apps, so feel free to dive in.
</p></li>
<li>Explore:
<p>
Explore tab lets you explore all repository available on github and also gives you some repository listed based on your interest, for example say you forked some android projects yesterday and some alternatives to these will pop up on your explore page. So , make sure check that out too.
