## My Experience :
#
As a student of Data Science, I find this facility extremely helpful in my studies. The hands on exercises and video lectures help me with the basics of any concept whatsoever.  In addition with the progress bar that keeps track of the percentage of course completed by us, there is a leader board where a group of individuals if belonging to the same class are ranked with respect to their XP points. This feature helps in maintaining a healthy competitive vibe amongst learners. The streak after completing each practice session everyday also adds to this. We are thus motivated to complete challenges and be at the top which is very much required today. This not only helps in maintaining our schedule but also helps us in the long run when we get a lot of work done in such short time.
