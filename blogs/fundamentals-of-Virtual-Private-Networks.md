<h1>Fundamentals of Virtual Private Networks </h1>

<p>A Virtual private network or VPN is a private network to protect your privacy across the public internet. </p>
<p>A common example is an employee at a company can use their home network to ‘tunnel’ into their office network using a virtual and secure connection. To ensure the same security and privacy of connection from their home across the public internet into their work; VPN secures this connection and ensures an experience similar to what they would have within their work environment from home but across the public internet.
</p>
<h2>How they work</h2>
<p>Users or companies can use VPNs to create an end to end private connection over a controlled and secure virtualised network.
The way a user’s connection is obfuscated by VPN is that their IP address is obscured and anyone trying to see the user’s activity only sees the IP of the VPN itself rather than the user’s local information. Not all VPNs are encrypted however and even if the IP address is safe from prying eyes, they may still be able to access the user data travelling through the VPN tunnel.
</p>
<h2>Data Encryption</h2>
<p>The very first VPNs were simply IP tunnels and did not encrypt any of the data and only protected the user’s IP address. VPNs are not secured on their own but often include additional layers of security on top of the VPN, such as the IPsec protocol which provides a framework to properly secure and encrypt the data. For the best VPN security do research on what kind of encryption protocols the VPN you’re using has before you trust them completely. VPN on its own does not necessarily always mean completely encrypted.
</p>
<h3>IPsec</h3>
<p>IPsec is a standard that mandates how VPNs can be secured over the public internet. It provides encryption and hashing to the data inside a VPN tunnel, preventing man in the middle attacks or sniffing data. The data is encrypted with a key when sent and decrypted using a paired key on the receivers side, meaning a hacker can only see a jumble of data that they cannot understand without cracking the key.
</p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<p>There are two types of VPNs
</p>
<h3>Remote Access</h3>
<p>The Remote access mode is not set up prior to use as it involves a changing connection from the host to the VPN provider- this style can be disabled and enabled anytime. The user’s computer is responsible for establishing and maintaining the VPN through software. 
</p>
<h3>Site to site</h3>
<p>Is a fixed VPN connection between workplaces, the users are unaware that they are using a VPN as they are configured from both ends at the gateway through the routers or similar and is already set up, so no software is required on the host’s computer and they can connect as normal. The VPN here is invisible to users.
